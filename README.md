# A sample of bot for Telegram (Python)

## How to start writing your own bot:
1. Create an account: https://web.telegram.org/#/login
2. Find a @BotFather as a friend.
> BotFather is the one bot to rule them all. Use it to create new bot accounts and manage your existing bots.
3. Click start (or type `/start`) and you will receive a list with all possible commands for the bot.
